I mean, it's only natural to respect someone who's towering over you, right?\"\n\nWould you rather answer:\n\nA. Marshall, that's not how it works. Respect is earned, not given because of height. I respect people who are kind, honest, and hardworking, not just because they're tall. You should focus on being a better person, not trying to be taller.\nB. Respect comes from character, not height, Marshall. I've seen giants with tiny hearts and dwarves with enormous courage. It's what's inside that counts, not how tall you stand.
